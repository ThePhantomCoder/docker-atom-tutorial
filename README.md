# Docker-Atom Tutorial
How to use Atom and Docker for Containerised fun.

### Why Atom?
Atom is one of the best text editors out there. It's cross-platform, modern, approachable, yet hackable. Also, Atom comes with a very large number of packages to customise your editor exactly as you want it, all installable from the GUI.

### Why Docker?
Docker is the worldâ€™s leading software container platform. Download a container with your favourite software preinstalled and start coding in seconds.

### Why Atom and Docker?
There's a package in Docker for pretty much everything, including an in-window terminal. This is beyond useful when creating Docker containers.

## Show me.
Alright, take it easy. I'll need something from you first ... Go to these two links and download + install both Docker and Atom:

Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
Atom: https://atom.io

### Atom + platformio-ide-terminal package
The most important Atom package to install is platformio-ide-terminal. It'll give you a terminal in your editor. Install it first by going to Atom's Preferences, select Install +, and search for 'platformio'. Here's a screenshot:

## In-window Terminal
After you've installed the platformio-ide-terminal package, you'll now have a '+' button at the bottom-left corner of your screen. Click on it to open a terminal window.

The magic starts with a very simple shortcut. Command+Enter on the Mac. I'll send the current line (or selection) from the text editor and run it in the terminal. This is great for scriptingless scriting.

It's simple, but fucking magical. It can save you so much time. Look at this screenshot. All commands were run from the text editor into the terminal by pressing Command+Enter three times.

Let's try running some Docker commands from out text editor by pressing Command+Enter. I'll leave you with one more screenshot, before moving to simply posting the commands here. You can do the copy/pasting.

## Docker Commands
There are many Docker commands available, so I'm going to focus only on the minimum to get you going on simple environments. If you want all the commands available, go here: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/docker/#child-commands

### Environment Info
Let's start with a few easy commands. 
The following will print your Docker Version, the Images available (might not have any yet), and the Containers running (might not have any yet).

```shell
# Print Docker Version
docker --version
# Print Docker Images (To be used to create Containers)
docker images
# Print Docker Containers
docker ps -a
# List Docker Networks
docker network ls
```
### Downloading your first Docker instance
There are hundreds of Docker instances ready to be downloaded with thousands of built in apps. A great place to look for available images is Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com, and also here in Github, there's loads on Github.

To download and run your docker instance, you'll need to run a 'docker run' command. When you run the command, Docker will go and download the image for you. The image might have for following components:

- OS (The whole point of Docker is that it can work without installing an OS, but on the Mac it does download the OS)
- Application (NGINX, MySQL, any many, many, many others)
- Additional OS or App Config.

A complete environment? Yes. Sounds to good to be true right? It does. Let's pick an application and test it out: Nginx.

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is an open source reverse proxy server for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols, as well as a load balancer, HTTP cache, and a web server (origin server). It's a great choice because it's a web server that immediately gives us a Web front-end to go to verify it all installed correctly.

To install NGINX on Debian, and get it ready for use, we could type the following command:

```shell
docker run -itd \
    --restart always \
    --name my-nginx \
    --hostname splunk_hf_ds \
    --volume "/tmp/:/tmp/" \
    -p 8080:80 \
  nginx:latest
```

Now go to http://localhost:8080 and you should see the Nginx Welcome screen. 

Yeah, that just happened.

### What do all those 'docker-run' modifiers mean?
Here's the full reference https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/

In short:

- '-i':    Keep STDIN open even if not attached
- '-t':    Allocate a pseudo-tty
- '-d':    Detached mode. Run the container in the background.

- '--restart':  Restart policy of always so that if the container exits, Docker will restart it.
- '--name':     Name of Docker container to be used to stop, start, remove the container. Name it as will.
- '--hostname': Hostname within Docker. Accessible from other Docker instances if within a Custom Docker Network.
- '--volume':   Maps Host volumes to Docker volumes so they are one and the same. <local>:<container>
- '-p':         Maps Host ports to Docker ports so they are one and the same. <local>:<container>

- 'nginx:latest': Download the nginx image, referencing the 'latest' version.

### Accessing your Instances
How can we get onto our Docker instance's shell? Easy:

```shell
docker exec -it my-nginx bash
```

You can even run commands without getting into the shell. This will push the 'rm' command into the nginx instance. 

```shell
docker exec -d my-nginx /bin/sh -c 'rm -rf /tmp/*'
```

### Managing your Instances
The following commands are a staple. You can probably guess what they do:

```shell
# Start, Stop and Remove your Instances
docker start my-nginx
docker stop my-nginx
docker rm my-nginx
docker rm --force my-nginx

# List your instances and Remove them if needed
docker images
docker rmi nginx
```

### Docker Networking
No issues, you can create as many networks as you like in Docker, and connect Containers to those networks.

The following is an example of two docker containers connected to a User Defined Network. UDF's are useful in many ways. One useful tip is that UDF's configure a DNS and update the /hosts file of all containers so every container in the network can access any other using the hostname configured when creating the container.

```shell
# Create a User-Defined bridge network (needed for DNS hostname discovery)
docker network create \
  --driver=bridge \
  --subnet=172.28.0.0/16 \
  --ip-range=172.28.5.0/24 \
  --gateway=172.28.5.254 \
  jupyter-splunk

# Create a docker container running an unauthenticated Jupyter instance.
docker run -itd \
  --restart always \
  --name jupyter \
  --hostname jupyter \
  --network=jupyter-splunk \
  -p 8888:8888 \
  -v "/tmp/:/home/jovyan/" \
  jupyter/datascience-notebook:latest \
  start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''

# Create a docker container running the latest Splunk version.
docker run -itd \
  --restart always \
  --name splunk \
  --hostname splunk \
  --network=jupyter-splunk \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e "SPLUNK_START_ARGS=--accept-license" \
  -e "SPLUNK_USER=root" \
  splunk/splunk:latest
```

You can now connect to either instance and ping the other using its hostname.

### Manage Docker Networks
Needed commands. Also easy to guess what they do:

```shell
# List all Docker Networks
docker network ls
# Remove Network
docker network rm jupyter-splunk
```
